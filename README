Fites - The fast, interactive, and trusty editing software

Features:
    * Full keyboard layout customization (via config.h)
    * Support for custom colour schemes (via config.h)
    * Add syntax highlighting support for your own language (via languages.h)
    * Automatic indexing of text files allowing for a kind of autocompletion

Usage:
    * fites <file>: Opens a file 
    * If you want the auto-completor to suggest some things, just add a .f-suggest in your current directory and enter phrases which you would want to see. Those take priority over other phrases

Autocompletion:
    Autocompletion possibilities have the following order: First, your own suggestions, then suggestions from your current file and finally suggestions from other files in your current directory (of files with the same extension)

F-Projects:
    * .fprj is a directory
    * in it, there are two files:
            * SUGGEST
                - This file contains *custom* suggestions. They will always take priority over indexed items. This file is managed by the user.
            * INDEX
                - This file is managed by the editor and indexes all of the files in order to get an overview over everything

      So, you may imagine this project as the kilo editor if it had taken enough steroids to wipe out Austria's population
