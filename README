Fites - The fast, interactive, and trusty editing software

Features:
    * Full keyboard layout customization (via config.h)
    * Support for custom colour schemes (via config.h)
    * Add syntax highlighting support for your own language (via languages.h)
    * Automatic indexing of text files allowing for a kind of autocompletion
    * Projects (.fprj)

Usage:
    * fites <file>: Opens a file in non-project mode unless there is a .fprj file present in the current directory
    * fites <file> -p / fites <file> --project / pfites <file>: Searches parent directories for .fprj file
    * fites -n / fites --new: initializes an .fprj

F-Projects:
    * .fprj is a directory
    * in it, there are two files:
            * SUGGEST
                - This file contains *custom* suggestions. They will always take priority over indexed items. This file is managed by the user.
            * INDEX
                - This file is managed by the editor and indexes all of the files in order to get an overview over everything

      So, you may imagine this project as the kilo editor if it had taken enough steroids to wipe out Austria's population
